# CPU_SIM
This project aims to simulate the inner workings of a computer.
I am currently trying to use the MIPS ISA such that it is easy to use it.

This a word-addressable CPU design.
Usable Address Space is only 16 bits to avoid very large structures.
I will maybe extend it to 32 bits if I find it necessary.

It's a work in progress.

Why is it coded in JAVA ? Because it's the language which I understand the best and I enjoy it so I just used Java..
Maybe I will switch to C++ at some point.

At the end of almost each important file, there is a side note about current research in Computer Architecture.
Almost all the papers come from the Safari laboratory led by Onur Mutlu.

For questions or anything just send me a message.
