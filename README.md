# CPU_SIM
This project aims to simulate the inner workings of a computer.

This a word-addressable CPU design.
Usable Address Space is only 16 bits to avoid very large structures.
I will maybe extend it to 32 bits if I find it necessary.

It's a work in progress.
I stopped working on this project to focus on something else.
I implemented a working memory design which works.With a bunch of included tests.
I may start again on this project but if I do I will implement a very exotic CPU.

Why is it coded in JAVA ? Because it's the language which I understand the best and I enjoy it so I just used Java.
Maybe I will switch to C++ at some point.

At the end of almost each important file, there is a side note about current research in Computer Architecture.
Almost all the papers come from the Safari laboratory led by Onur Mutlu.

For questions or anything just send me a message.
